            <h2>Here's what you <em>need.</em></h2>

            <!-- Ingredients of dish. -->

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Pizza Dough</strong>:You <em>have</em> As usual, I used my go-to whole wheat pizza dough.
                When made with white whole wheat flour, it doesn't even taste like whole wheat!</li>

              <li><strong>San Marzano Tomatoes</strong>:San Marzano tomatoes are a special variety of plum tomato originating from the San Marzano region near Naples, Italy. San Marzano tomatoes are tender and rich in flavor.
                Even the tomato sauce inside the can is thicker than most other whole canned tomatoes. They are special.</li>
              
              <li><strong>Mozzarella Balls</strong>:You can add more if you'd like, but <em>never</em> add less!</li>
              
              <li><strong>Fresh Basil</strong>:Because I don't drain off the grease in this recipe, I recommend a lean
              ground beef to keep the sauce from being too greasy.</li>
              
              <li><strong>Olive Oil & Salt</strong>:Margherita pizza is not complete without a light drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Be careful as you pour so you don't accidentally overdo it.</li>  
            </ul>        


            <h2>Now it's time to bring it all together.</h2>
            <h6><i>Here's where the magic happens.</i></h6>

            <ol>
                <li>Sweat the onions, celery, carrots, and garlic in a large pot on the stovetop.</li>
                <li>Add the ground beef and season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Break up the beef and cook until it’s browned, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Stir in the milk and simmer until it mostly evaporates.</li>
                <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and remaining seasonings.</li>
                <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then simmer on low, uncovered, until the sauce is thick and flavorful.</li>
            </ol>


                <h4>Now to make the bolognese sauce.</h4>

            <ol>
                    <li><strong>Let it simmer for at least 30 minutes, and preferably one hour.</strong>Traditional Bolognese in Italy is cooked for around 2 hours.
                    That’s because Bolognese gets better the longer it’s cooked, allowing more flavor depth.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Stir occasionally.</strong>To make sure the sauce cooks evenly, be sure to stir it every 10 minutes or so during the simmering time.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Toss the pasta with the Bolognese sauce, instead of serving it on top.</strong>
                        This may seem like just a preference, but there’s actually a scientific reason behind it.
                        When you toss the pasta with the sauce, it allows the sauce to emulsify and thicken, which means it sticks better to the pasta.
                        And that means every bite of pasta is adequately coated in this heavenly sauce.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Use fresh herbs.</strong>
                        While you can start with dried herbs, I highly recommend also adding fresh herbs. You can do this before you start the simmering process
                        and/or after you finish cooking the sauce. This will liven the pasta dish and add a fresh and aromatic flavor.
                    </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>And <i>voila!</i></h2>
