            <h2>Here's what you <em>need.</em></h2>

            <!-- Ingredients of dish. -->

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Pizza Dough</strong>:You <em>have</em> As usual, I used my go-to whole wheat pizza dough.
                When made with white whole wheat flour, it doesn't even taste like whole wheat!</li>

              <li><strong>San Marzano Tomatoes</strong>:San Marzano tomatoes are a special variety of plum tomato originating from the San Marzano region near Naples, Italy. San Marzano tomatoes are tender and rich in flavor.
                Even the tomato sauce inside the can is thicker than most other whole canned tomatoes. They are special.</li>
              
              <li><strong>Mozzarella Balls</strong>:Look for mozzarella balls packed in water, rather than vacuum-sealed.</li>
              
              <li><strong>Fresh Basil</strong>:Fresh basil is absolutely essential. Once the pizza is out of the oven, sprinkle a handful of finely sliced basil on each pizza.</li>
              
              <li><strong>Olive Oil & Salt</strong>:Margherita pizza is not complete without a light drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Be careful as you pour so you don't accidentally overdo it.</li>  
            </ul>        


            <h2>Now it's time to bring it all together.</h2>
            <h6><i>Here's where the magic happens.</i></h6>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit with a rack in the upper third of the oven.</li>
                <li>Place a medium mixing bowl in the sink and pour the canned tomatoes into the bowl, juices and all. </li>
                <li>Distribute the mozzarella over the pizza, concentrating it a bit more in the center of the pizza, as it will melt toward the edges.</li>
                <li>Bake pizzas individually on the top rack until the crust is golden and the cheese is just turning golden, about 10 to 12 minutes (or significantly less, if you’re using a baking stone/steel—keep an eye on it).</li>
                <li>Top each pizza generously with fresh basil, followed by a light back-and-forth drizzle of olive oil, a sprinkling of salt, and red pepper flakes, if you wish. Slice and enjoy.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>And <i>voila!</i></h2>
