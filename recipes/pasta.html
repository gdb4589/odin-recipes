              <!-- Short description of the dish. -->             
            
              <p><em>Isn't that beautiful?</em> A classic Italian dish where al dente pasta meets a hearty ground beef sauce slow-cooked with onions, garlic, and tomatoes.
                The addition of milk helps tenderize the beef and also adds a note of richness to the flavorful bolognese sauce. It's a family-friendly dinner everyone
                will love!</p>

            <p></p>

            <h2>Here's what you <em>need.</em></h2>

            <!-- Ingredients of dish. -->

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Olive Oil</strong>:You <em>have</em> to use olive oil when making Italian food! Any other oil just won't cut it.</li>

              <li><strong>Onion, celery, and carrots</strong>:These ingredients form the base of flavor for a lot of your favorite soup
              recipes, and they do the same in Bolognese sauce.</li>
              
              <li><strong>Garlic</strong>:You can add more if you'd like, but <em>never</em> add less!</li>
              
              <li><strong>Lean ground beef</strong>:Because I don't drain off the grease in this recipe, I recommend a lean
              ground beef to keep the sauce from being too greasy.</li>
              
              <li><strong>Whole milk</strong>:I recommend sticking with whole milk, rather than swapping in a lighter version.
              It adds a lot of richness to the sauce.</li>
              
              <li><strong>Crushed tomatoes</strong>:Crushed tomatoes give us more texture than canned tomato sauce,
              but they're more broken down than diced tomatoes. This makes them perfect for pasta sauce.</li>
              
              <li><strong>Tomato paste</strong>:Tomato paste isn’t just to intensify the tomato flavor; it also adds umami.</li>
              
              <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>:You'll need the standard salt and pepper, along with a bay leaf, oregano, and nutmeg.</li>
              
              <li><strong>Tagliatelle pasta</strong>:Or your pasta of choice.</li>
            </ul>        


            <h2>Now it's time to bring it all together.</h2>
            <h6><i>Here's where the magic happens.</i></h6>

            <ol>
                <li>Sweat the onions, celery, carrots, and garlic in a large pot on the stovetop.</li>
                <li>Add the ground beef and season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Break up the beef and cook until it’s browned, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Stir in the milk and simmer until it mostly evaporates.</li>
                <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and remaining seasonings.</li>
                <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then simmer on low, uncovered, until the sauce is thick and flavorful.</li>
            </ol>


                <h4>Now to make the bolognese sauce.</h4>

            <ol>
                    <li><strong>Let it simmer for at least 30 minutes, and preferably one hour.</strong>Traditional Bolognese in Italy is cooked for around 2 hours.
                    That’s because Bolognese gets better the longer it’s cooked, allowing more flavor depth.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Stir occasionally.</strong>To make sure the sauce cooks evenly, be sure to stir it every 10 minutes or so during the simmering time.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Toss the pasta with the Bolognese sauce, instead of serving it on top.</strong>
                        This may seem like just a preference, but there’s actually a scientific reason behind it.
                        When you toss the pasta with the sauce, it allows the sauce to emulsify and thicken, which means it sticks better to the pasta.
                        And that means every bite of pasta is adequately coated in this heavenly sauce.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Use fresh herbs.</strong>
                        While you can start with dried herbs, I highly recommend also adding fresh herbs. You can do this before you start the simmering process
                        and/or after you finish cooking the sauce. This will liven the pasta dish and add a fresh and aromatic flavor.
                    </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>And <i>voila!</i></h2>
