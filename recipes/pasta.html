              <!-- Short description of the dish. -->             
            <p><em>Isn't that beautiful?</em> A classic Italian dish where al dente pasta meets a hearty ground beef sauce slow-cooked with onions, garlic, and tomatoes.
                The addition of milk helps tenderize the beef and also adds a note of richness to the flavorful bolognese sauce. It's a family-friendly dinner everyone
                will love!</p>
